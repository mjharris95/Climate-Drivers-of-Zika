Code and data accompanying manuscript “Climate drives spatial variation in Zika epidemic characteristics in Latin America.”

cov0701.RData contains all climate, epidemiological, and other data used to intialize the spatiotemporal and spatial models

covprov gives the province-level spatial characteristics used to fit the spatial models

data126 contains smoothed epidemiological data for all 155 provinces considered for this study

manualweather gives daily weather data for the provinces included in these analyses

provinceleveldata gives land area, elevation, and the population of the largest city for each province

TSIR is the code used to fit the TSIR model and initialize the epidemiological variables used in these analyses

Spatiotemporal Model fits the two-way panel spatiotemporal hurdle model, as well as alternative models discussed in Supplementary Materials.

Spatial Model fits the spatial models and calculates confidence intervals for the thermal optima of models with a nonlinear effect of temperature

Figures generates precursors to the figures used in the text, which were further manually combined and edited
